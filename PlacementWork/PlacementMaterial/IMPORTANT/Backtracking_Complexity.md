1. For each question first try to generate a tree. Then for that tree try to estimate the total leaf nodes that may create in worst case. 
> Like for Permutation problem we know that there maybe `n!` possible results that can be produced.
2. And after that we need to find complexity for each iteration- (Generally its O(N) for adding cur array in result array)
3. Then overall time complexity will be multiplication result of 1 * 2
